         title: "Vaultleap Platform and Services",
         content: `Non-Custodial Interface
      
The Vaultleap Platform is a non-custodial, decentralized interface that enables users ("Interface Users") to interact with smart contracts on the blockchain network. 

The platform provides:
1. A user interface for interacting with autonomous smart contracts
2. Technical tools for viewing blockchain data
3. Interface access for smart contract deployment and interaction

Importantly, Klydo:
- Never takes custody or control of user funds
- Cannot access, freeze, or move user assets
- Has no ability to reverse or modify smart contract transactions
- Functions solely as a technical interface to the blockchain

All transactions are executed directly by users through immutable smart contracts on the blockchain network, with users maintaining exclusive control over their private keys and assets at all times.

Smart Contract Functionality

Through the interface, users can:
1. Create Vaults: Deploy smart contracts that define automated distribution rules
2. Set Allocations: Configure percentage-based distribution parameters
3. Manage Roles: Define recipient designations within the smart contracts
4. Execute Claims: Interact with contracts to claim allocated funds

All these functions are executed directly on the blockchain through smart contracts, without Klydo's intervention or control.

Smart Contract Interface and Operations

The Vaultleap Platform provides a technical interface for interacting with blockchain-based smart contracts ("Vaults"). These smart contracts operate with the following characteristics and limitations:

1. Technical Architecture
   Smart contracts:
   - Execute autonomously on the blockchain
   - Operate independently of Klydo
   - Follow immutable programmed logic
   - Maintain self-custodial asset control
   - Cannot be modified after deployment

2. Vault Development and Deployment
   Process flow:
   - Smart contracts are publicly verifiable
   - Code execution is autonomous
   - Deployment is user-initiated
   - Operations are blockchain-controlled
   - Asset custody remains with users

3. Platform Limitations
   Klydo explicitly cannot:
   - Modify deployed smart contracts
   - Access or control contract funds
   - Override transaction execution
   - Alter contract parameters
   - Take custody of any assets
